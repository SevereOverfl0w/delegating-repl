= Delegating ClojureScript REPL

image::https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/io.dominic/delegating-repl.svg[Clojars Project, link=https://clojars.org/io.dominic/delegating-repl, opts=interactive]

This is a ClojureScript REPL which simply delegates to another.
By wrapping another REPL in this way, we can add useful actions around certain parts of the lifecycle.

The only feature supported now is `:launch-command`, which is an alternative to the `:launch-browser` option in the browser repl where you choose how to launch.
The `:launch-command` is also run on a separate thread in order to avoid it holding up the launch of your tests.

This is most useful with https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha-cljs[kaocha-cljs] due to https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2493[CLJ-2493].
But it is likely useful with other ClojureScript environments also.
